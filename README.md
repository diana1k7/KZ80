Mini Z80 to use i2c with multiple processor sharing

Hi,
     A new project to test ideas of exploring retro game consumer and adding differing mpc's.  The first uses a z80 cmos wiry atmega328, others have done this amdvi found pcb's on ebay I'm planning to order.  This implementation I'm adding a mc68k along with xeon to take advantage of various solving and coordinate to greater uses.  Also, this project uses off the shelf design as I believe like Adam Osborne of "plain vanilla," design.  Yes. I owned two Osborne 1s blue case and used in my early career as a medical researcher and later AI, Cognitive computer neurology projects.

     Let me know what you think.
